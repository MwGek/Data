OAAB_Cells.esp is for mod developers only and is not needed for any OAAB-dependent mods to function.
The plugin contains cells starting with OAAB_ which serve 2 functions:

1. Palette cells (e.g. copy things into your working cell)
2. Showcases with example scripts for certain assets (see InfoBox markers which contain extra info about certain assets)

OAAB_Cells is a work in progress. Constantly being added to and improved. Make sure to check for updates periodically.
You should load this up alongside your project in the Construction Set so you can easily copy from and reference it.
You do not need to load this in your game unless you want to test some of the script functionality.
